   I am proud to be a CHICANA! 
              
  I have 3 sisters and have 11 pets. They are 3 dogs, 5 cats and 3 geckos. 
  
  I like to be around family members and like to be in the outdoors. 
  
  I'm currently attending Oakland Unity High School. 
  
  I'm going into my junior year. I will be graduating high school in 2019.
  
  I like technology and enjoy going into STEM related programs. 
  
  I like to challenge myself and try new things.
  
  I have been in a program called Techbridegirls since middle school and currently still in it. 
  
  I'm also doing a summer internship in San Francisco called Girls Who Code. 
  
  In this internship we created our own videogames with the use of coding.
